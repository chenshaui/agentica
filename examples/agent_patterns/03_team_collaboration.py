@description: Multi-agent collaboration demo via Agent.as_tool().

Composes specialised worker agents as tools on a single orchestrator agent.
``Agent.as_tool()`` is the lightweight composition primitive at the Agent
level — for parallel autonomous execution use ``Swarm``, for ad-hoc isolated
sub-tasks use the ``BuiltinTaskTool`` / ``SubagentRegistry`` runtime.

1. Researcher agent - Searches and analyzes articles
2. Writer agent - Writes articles based on research
3. Coordinator agent - Calls them as tools in the right order
